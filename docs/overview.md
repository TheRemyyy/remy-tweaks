## Project Vision

Remy Tweaks is built for power users who want a clean, fast, and private Windows environment without the overhead of modern "bloatware". Unlike black-box optimization tools, Remy Tweaks is open-source and modular, allowing you to audit every line of code before execution.

## Core Principles

1.  **Transparency**: Every tweak is visible in the source code.
2.  **Performance First**: Focused on reducing system latency and maximizing throughput.
3.  **Privacy by Default**: Telemetry and data collection are treated as bugs.
4.  **No Placeholders**: Functional, production-ready tweaks only.
